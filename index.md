# About

I am a mathematician. My job is a Research Scientist on the machine learning team at [Upstart](https://www.upstart.com/). I also do research in pure mathematics. My research interests are in number theory and arithmetic algebraic geometry, and I am particularly interested in motives
and motivic Galois theory.
