# About

I am a mathematician turned data scientist. I work as a senior research scientist on the machine learning team at [Upstart](https://www.upstart.com/).

In my previous life I was an academic, doing research in pure math (which I still continue to a limited extent). My research is mainly in number theory and arithmetic algebraic geometry, though I like to think about lots of other kinds of math as well. I am particularly interested in motives and motivic Galois theory.
