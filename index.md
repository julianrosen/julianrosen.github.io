# About

Mathematician turned data scientist. I am employed as a senior research scientist on the machine learning team at [Upstart](https://www.upstart.com/), where I work on predictive models in the consumer lending space.

In a previous life I was an academic, doing research in pure math (which I still continue to an extent). My research is mainly in number theory and arithmetic algebraic geometry, though I also enjoy thinking about other kinds of math. I am particularly interested in motives and motivic Galois theory.
