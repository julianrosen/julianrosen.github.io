# Computing


Here you can find some of my computing projects.

---
### MHS
This is software for finding and symbolically proving combinatorial congruences using multiple harmonic sums and p-adic multiple zeta values.
Available at <a href="https://github.com/julianrosen/mhs" target="_blank">https://github.com/julianrosen/mhs</a>.

### Recurrence sequences

A SageMath package for performing symbolic calculations with linear recurrence sequences. This code implements some of the 
calculations in my paper [A finite analogue of the ring of algebraic number](pdf/Rosen_2020_A_finite_analogue_of_the_ring_of_algebraic_numbers.pdf). The code is
available at <a href="https://github.com/julianrosen/recurrence" target="_blank">https://github.com/julianrosen/recurrence</a>.

### COVID-19 Hospitalization Forecaster

Lara Du, Kai Wei and myself developed a machine learning tool to predict the number of hospital beds that
will be needed for COVID-19 patients in each state, up to 14 days in the future. Our prediction tool
comes with an API and a website, and comes in a docker container for easy deployment. The website for our
project is <a href="https://covidforecast.net" target="_blank">https://covidforecast.net</a>, and the GitHub repository with our code is at
<a href="https://github.com/czkaiweb/ErdosProject-COVID" target="_blank">https://github.com/czkaiweb/ErdosProject-COVID</a>.

### Mudpi

Mudpi is a multiplayer online text-based adventure game that I put together during the pandemic in order to
keep in touch with some friends I could no longer visit with. Mudpi was originally hosted on a Raspberry Pi on
my home internet (whence the name), but now sits on a virtual private server. Mudpi can be accessed through a web 
browser at <a href="https://muttmutt.net/mudpi" target="_blank">https://muttmutt.net/mudpi</a>, and the source code can be found at
<a href="https://github.com/julianrosen/mudpi" target="_blank">https://github.com/julianrosen/mudpi</a>.
